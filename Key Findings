Key Findings

Formality is a discoverable linear direction in GPT-2's activation space
Bidirectional control: Can both increase and decrease formality
Robust to noise: Vector contains tokenization artifacts but still produces clean behavioral control
Layer-specific: Strongest effects at layer 20 (late but not final layer)
